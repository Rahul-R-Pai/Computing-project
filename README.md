Project: Rock Paper Scissor

The libraries used in this program are tkinter and random

Instructions:

When the user runs the py file, an interface opens.

First, the user has to input the 'maximum score to win the game' in the space provided and click OK to verify the input.

Then the user can choose any one of the three options: Rock, Paper, Scissor

The result of the output is printed along with the scores of that round and user's and computer's points.

The user can keep on playing until the first to reach the maximum score wins the game.

The user can then choose to either play again or exit the game.

If the user chooses play again, the exit button will still be visible in case the user wants to exit in the middle of the game.
